# devbench

A standalone SKSE plugin that hosts a **general test bench for Skyrim mod development**:
an in-process server that exposes mod functionality to **AI agents (MCP)** and to **plain
HTTP clients (REST)** through one endpoint, on `127.0.0.1`.

It is transport-agnostic by design. A `ToolRegistry` is the single source of truth; the MCP
and REST adapters _reflect_ it, so a tool registered once is reachable over both protocols
automatically. Other SKSE mods register their own tools through a small C ABI, turning
devbench into a shared bench rather than a per-mod server.

## What devbench does for developers

devbench lets an **AI agent, a test script, or CI drive and measure a running Skyrim** — no
alt-tabbing, no hand-clicking. One local endpoint, MCP for agents and REST for scripts, and a
shared registry every mod can extend.

- **Automated testing.** Run console commands and read their output, inspect live
  engine/plugin state, answer menus, load saves — then chain them with the **`scenario`** tool:
  a timed step list that waits on _real_ events (`waitFor postLoadGame`) instead of guessed
  sleeps, can `repeat`, and returns a per-step transcript. Steps dispatch **any registered
  tool** (including ones your mod adds), so a scenario can flip your feature mid-run and assert
  the result.
- **Record / replay.** **`record`** captures a manual play-through — trajectory, point-of-view,
  cell transitions (doors/`coc`), and the console commands you typed — into a portable file you
  replay deterministically: by hand, on a hotkey, or unattended on load (`autoRun`). The entry
  point (the save you loaded) is captured too, so a replay re-establishes the scene first.
- **Performance / A-B testing.** A recorded play-through replays the **same path and conditions
  every run**, so an A/B shader/feature comparison measures the _change_, not your hands.
  devbench publishes **semantic `EventBus` events** — `record.started`/`record.stopped`,
  `scene.cellLoaded`, `menu`, `lifecycle`, `health.stalled`/`health.resumed` — so a profiler client can align a capture to those
  boundaries; pair it with a Tracy-instrumented build (via the `tracy` MCP) to attribute
  frametime/GPU cost to a specific moment, toggle a feature through its tool, replay the same
  recipe, and diff the numbers.
- **Why wire it into your mod.** Register your mod's operations as devbench tools over a tiny
  **MIT** C-ABI (`RegisterTool` / `EmitEvent`) and they instantly appear on **both** MCP and
  REST — so AI assistants (Claude, Cursor), test scripts, and CI can toggle your features, read
  your state, trigger your captures, and benchmark you, all through one shared bench. You write
  the handler; discovery, JSON-Schema docs, and both transports come for free. Because every mod
  registers into the **same** server, one agent session can orchestrate across your whole load
  order. [Open Shaders](https://github.com/alandtse/open-shaders) does this today.

## Design

```

                                                              ▲                ▲
                                              ┌───────────────┴──────┐         │
                                         McpAdapter             RestAdapter ───┘
                                         (/mcp, JSON-RPC)       (/api/*, plain HTTP)
                                              └──────────┬───────────┘
                                                  one httplib server, one port
```

- **`ToolRegistry`** — name → `{descriptor, handler}`. Handlers are JSON-in / JSON-out and
  run on the listener thread; handlers that touch game/render state marshal to the main
  thread via `MainThread::RunAndWait`, which **returns the value synchronously** (the
  agentic-renderdoc model: an agent gets data back, not just an ack).
- **`EventBus`** — fan-out for notifications (e.g. shader recompiles): MCP notifications for
  agents, `GET /api/events?since=N` polling or SSE for HTTP clients.
- **Adapters** — generic; neither contains a tool name. The descriptor's JSON Schema doubles
  as the MCP `inputSchema` and the REST `GET /api/tools` documentation.

The tool surface is intentionally **thin and powerful** (an `eval`/`console` primitive plus a
small set of conveniences) rather than a tool per operation.

## Safety

Bound to `127.0.0.1` only. The bench has no auth and can execute arbitrary commands in the
game process — that is acceptable for a _local dev bench_ but it must never be bound to a
network-reachable address, and `eval`-class tools are gated behind an explicit enable.

## MCP client setup

Two ways to connect an MCP client, for two different needs:

- **Direct**, for a quick single-session debug: point your client at `http://127.0.0.1:8920/mcp`
  (or `8921`, or whatever `runtime.json` reports). Zero extra setup, but the connection dies the
  instant the game process exits — including every rebuild-and-relaunch during normal dev
  iteration — and needs a manual reconnect.
- **[devbench-bridge](bridge/README.md)**, for anything that needs to survive the game
  restarting: a small companion process your MCP client spawns over stdio, which proxies to
  devbench's REST API instead of connecting to `/mcp` directly. Ships inside the install
  (`Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench/devbench-bridge.exe`) — call the `mcp_bridge_setup` tool (or read
  `GET /api/tools`'s `mcp_bridge` field, or `mcp-bridge.json` next to `runtime.json`) for the
  exact config snippet to paste into your client.

## Build

xmake, C++23, CommonLibSSE-NG (submodule). cpp-mcp is vendored as the `lib/cpp-mcp`
submodule and built in-tree as a static-lib target (`xmake/cpp-mcp.lua`, mirroring
Community Shaders' `cmake/cpp-mcp.cmake`): only its four server TUs are compiled, and a
build-tree header mirror applies two edits — pointing `mcp_message.h` at our
`nlohmann/json.hpp` (single ABI) and adding a public `http()` getter to `mcp_server.h` so
the REST facade can share the MCP port.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
xmake
# auto-deploy: set SkyrimPluginTargets to ';'-separated game Data dirs before building
```

## Configuration

Headless config (no in-game menu yet) at `Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench/config.json` — read
once at `kPostLoad` (before any consumer's `kDataLoaded`), then the server starts.
Missing → auto-created with defaults. Invalid → defaults (logged). All keys are optional.

```jsonc
{
  "enabled": true, // start the MCP/REST server at all (default true)
  "port": 8920, // localhost port for /mcp and /api. Default is per-runtime — SE/AE 8920, VR 8921 — so a fixed MCP client URL is stable; set explicitly to override. Iterates only if the chosen port is busy (rare; logged), bound port in runtime.json.
  "logLevel": "info", // trace|debug|info|warn|error (default "info")

  // In-game hotkeys (DXScanCode integers; 0 = disabled). Ignored while the console is open.
  "recordHotkey": 0, // toggle record start/stop
  "recordHotkeyShift": false, // require Shift held with recordHotkey
  "replayHotkey": 0, // replay a recording
  "replayHotkeyShift": false, // require Shift held with replayHotkey
  "replayPath": "", // recording to replay; empty = most recent
  "replayRestoreScene": true, // hotkey replay re-establishes the recorded scene
  "recordIntervalMs": 10, // record: pose sample period in ms (10..1800000); per-call intervalMs overrides

  // Autorun: replay a recording once on the first load of the session (unattended benchmark).
  "autoRunPath": "", // recording to replay on first postLoadGame; empty = off
  "autoRunRestoreScene": true, // autorun loads the recording's entry save first

  // Settle delay (ms) after a restore-load before the replayed trajectory runs.
  // Hardware-dependent; not baked into the portable recording file.
  "loadSettleMs": 3000,

  // Scene coupling: how strictly a replay reproduces the recorded entry, by how long
  // before record-start the save/coc was brokered (stored per recipe as entryPoint.ageMs).
  //   age <= couplingAnchorMs : "anchored" — restore the entry + re-apply recorded time/weather
  //   age <= couplingCellMs   : "cell"     — restore the entry
  //   else                    : "worldspace" — skip the restore; only assert the worldspace
  // A recipe may override the tier/thresholds in its meta.coupling block.
  "couplingAnchorMs": 10000,
  "couplingCellMs": 60000,

  // A raw coc/cow can stream between scenes without the loading-screen teardown some mods
  // need to free resources (→ CTD). When true, a coc/cow restore first bounces through
  // cleanTransitionCell to force a clean loading screen. Save-loads already tear down.
  "cleanTransition": true,
  "cleanTransitionCell": "QASmoke",

  // If the engine frame counter hasn't advanced for this long (ms), publish a
  // "health.stalled" EventBus event (and "health.resumed" once it recovers) — catches a
  // frozen main thread, which a menu/lifecycle event can never report on its own (those are
  // published BY the main thread). 0 disables the watchdog.
  "stallWatchdogMs": 5000,
}
```

`enabled: false` skips starting the server entirely. Bind address is fixed to `127.0.0.1`.
The port is **deterministic per runtime** — **SE/AE `8920`, VR `8921`** — so a fixed MCP client URL
never moves; set `port` explicitly to override. If the chosen port is already taken (e.g. a second
instance of the same runtime), devbench iterates to the next free port (logged) and writes the bound
port to `Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench/runtime.json` (`{ "port": N }`) for discovery. Under a VFS mod
manager (MO2, …) that path is virtual and unreachable from outside the manager's own hook, so the
same file is also mirrored to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\devbench\<se|vr>\runtime.json`, which isn't
virtualized — devbench-bridge checks both and uses whichever is freshest.

## Connect an MCP client

devbench serves **streamable-HTTP MCP at `POST http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`** — most clients connect
natively, no extra process:

```sh
# Claude Code — register both games; the one that's running has live tools, the other shows disconnected
claude mcp add --transport http devbench-se http://127.0.0.1:8920/mcp   # SE/AE
claude mcp add --transport http devbench-vr http://127.0.0.1:8921/mcp   # VR
```

For a **stdio-only** client, bridge with the off-the-shelf `mcp-remote` (no devbench-specific binary):
`{ "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:8920/mcp", "--allow-http"] }`. Plain
HTTP scripts/CI use REST (`/api/tool/<name>`) and need no client config. devbench advertises
`tools.listChanged` and emits `notifications/tools/list_changed`, so tools that register after connect
(a mod loading, or the game finishing load) surface without reconnecting.

`GET /api/health` is the one endpoint answered off the main thread (no `RunAndWait`) — a fast,
always-returning liveness + identity probe: `{ ok, lastLifecycle, frame, lastTaskFrame,
pendingTasks, pid, port, exe, vr }`. Because it never waits on the main thread, it keeps
answering while a normal tool call would `504` on a legitimately busy main thread (e.g. a long
synchronous shader compile after a deploy). Read it as: `frame` advancing = busy but alive;
`frame` frozen = hung **or** paused/console-open/loading (a frozen frame alone is not proof of a
hang); `pendingTasks > 0` while `lastTaskFrame` stops advancing = the main-thread task queue is
starved. `pid`/`port`/`exe`/`vr` identify which instance answered, so a client pinned to one port
spots a multi-instance misattach in one call (`frame < 0` = counter unresolved / not in-game).
MCP clients (which speak `tools/call`, not REST GET) get the same off-thread signal via
`inspect kind=health` — no new tool, just another `inspect` kind.

## Built-in tools

All tools are reachable over both MCP (`tools/call`) and REST (`POST /api/tool/<name>`).

| Tool       | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Useful for `getav`, `getpos`, `help`, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `inspect`  | Read live game/plugin state. Runs on the main thread and returns synchronously. `kind='state'` → `{ plugin, version, vr, playerLoaded, frame, pid, port, exe }`. `'health'` → off-thread liveness+identity `{ frame, lastTaskFrame, pendingTasks, pid, port, exe, vr }` — the only kind answered without the main thread, so it keeps replying while a busy main thread would 504 (see `GET /api/health` above). `'vm'` → Papyrus VM health `{ loadedTypes, attachedScripts, arrays, runningStacks, frozenStacks, overstressed }`. `'scene'` → player context `{ cell, worldspace, location, position, gameHour, daysPassed, weather }`. `'mods'` → active load order `{ count, lightCount, total, plugins:[{index, name}], lightPlugins:[…] }` (full and light plugins are separate index spaces; the env fingerprint a repro/CI run pins against). `'player'` → player snapshot `{ name, level, sex, gold, race, actorValues:{health,magicka,stamina,carryWeight each {current,max}}, equipped:{right,left,ammo} }`. `'inventory'` → items held by the player (or a container `formId`) `{ owner, count, items:[{formId, name, formType, count, value, weight, equipped}] }` (filters: `formType`, `limit`). `'quests'` → journal (running/completed) `{ count, quests:[{formId, name, stage, type, active, completed, objectives:[{index, text, state}]}] }` (`limit`). `'effects'` → active magic effects on the player (or an actor `formId`) `{ target, count, activeEffects:[{spell, effect, magnitude, duration, elapsed}] }`. `'refs'` → identify reference(s) sharing one shape `{ formId, formType, name, editorId, base, position }`: pass `formId` for one form, `selected=true` for the console/crosshair ref (set via `prid`), or neither to enumerate loaded refs in the grid (filters: `formType`, `radius`, `limit`). A consumer mod can add a custom `kind` via the C-ABI `RegisterToolExtension` (e.g. load-timing data); `kind='extensions'` lists the registered kinds + descriptors and `kind=<registered>` dispatches to it. |
| `input`    | Versioned synthetic input. Call `action='capabilities'` first. Contract v2 retains the owned, bounded `keyboard` actions and adds `vrTrackedSet`: one prevalidated asynchronous sequence in which every frame atomically defines the HMD plus both controllers' OpenVR pose and full packet/button/touch/axis state. Read-only `action='observe'` returns that same complete canonical frame from the physical OpenVR runtime, allowing a caller to preserve current poses while compiling a bounded action. VR replay hooks the compositor/system interfaces Skyrim reads and passes the real runtime through unchanged while inactive. Individual VR devices or buttons cannot be injected separately, preventing pose and control state from drifting onto different clocks. A VR sequence start returns an opaque `controlToken` required for external stop/release; cross-owner cleanup and lifecycle survival are internal-only. Failed controller restoration remains explicit and retryable. Keyboard expiry retries until release succeeds or its generation becomes obsolete. Ad-hoc input stops on load/new-game; recording replay may survive only the lifecycle events it is reproducing and is released by replay cleanup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `game`     | Save/load and list saves. `action='list'` enumerates the saves directory. `'loadLast'` loads the most recent save (a settled real-game state — avoids `coc`'s heavy new-game init). `'load'`/`'save'` take a `'name'`. All mutating actions are fire-and-forget; watch `lifecycle` events for completion. `'setTimeScale'` (params `'scale'` 0.1..3.0, optional `'holdMs'` default 60000, `'freeze'`/`'allowHigh'`/`'allowTimeScale'`) changes the game's own speed for a bounded lease and then restores the previous scale — that is what makes a replay or scenario finish sooner in wall time; it answers only once the engine is actually running at the requested scale, `'getTimeScale'` reports `{ requested, effective, owner, leased, leaseRemainingMs }` without changing anything and is never refused; `'setTimeScale'` is refused (409) while a recording or capture is in flight unless `'allowTimeScale':true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `menu`     | Inspect, open, answer, or dismiss menus. `'list'` → `{ openMenus, messageBoxOpen }`. `'describe'` → active `MessageBoxMenu` body + buttons. `'accept'` → answer a `MessageBoxMenu` by button index (runs its callback; this is how you clear a Yes/No modal). `'open'` → show a menu by name via the UI queue (`kShow`); opens hub menus from a plain name (`TweenMenu`, `Journal Menu`, `MagicMenu`, …); context menus needing a target ref (`ContainerMenu`/`BarterMenu`/`BookMenu`) won't open this way. `'close'` → hide a menu by name via the UI queue (`kHide`). `'invoke'` → dispatch to a consumer-registered menu handler by `name` (a mod exposes its menu's interaction via the C-ABI `RegisterMenuHandler` instead of adding its own tool, keeping the surface to this one tool); `'list'` returns those names under `registered`, and `'describe'` with a `name` returns that handler's descriptor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `papyrus`  | Inspect the live Papyrus surface and invoke functions, returning the value. `'list'` → loaded script class names `{ total, returned, truncated, scripts }` (optional `filter`, `limit`). `'describe'` `{ script }` → that class's `{ globalFunctions, memberFunctions, properties }`, each function with params + return type. `'call'` `{ script, function, args?, self?, timeoutMs? }` runs a function via the VM and returns `{ called, returned, returnedType }` — unlike console `cgf`, the return value comes back (e.g. `Utility.GetCurrentGameTime` → a Float). Pass `self` for a **member** call: `{ "form": "0x14 \| editorId" }` targets any form, or `"selected"` uses the console/crosshair ref (set via `prid`); without `self`, only globals/native are callable. Args and returns support bool/number/string, `{ "form": … }` (a form return resolves to `{ formId, formType, editorId, name }`), and arrays of scalars. Omitted trailing **optional** params are padded to the type's neutral default (`None`/`0`/`0.0`/`false`/`""`) — the VM doesn't fill them, and a short arg list otherwise makes reference ops (`MoveTo`, `Disable`, `Kill`) silently no-op; pass explicit values for any optional whose real default isn't neutral (e.g. `StringUtil.Substring`'s `-1`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `scenario` | Run a timed sequence of steps server-side and return a per-step transcript. Steps: `tool` (dispatch any registered tool), `wait` (fixed ms), `waitFor` (block on a Skyrim event), `waitUntil` (poll live state). Optional: `repeat` (≤1000), `continueOnError`. See [Scripted tests](#scripted-tests) below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `wait`     | Advance time by waiting `{ hours }`, synchronously and without touching the Wait menu's UI — starts the wait, then drives its completion (autosave, script events) to done before returning; no polling needed. Returns `{ completed:true, hours }`, or `{ completed:false, reason }` on the same gate the menu itself enforces (combat, trespassing, midair, hostiles nearby, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `record`   | Capture a manual play-through as a versioned activity trace and replayable scenario. `'start'` samples player pose + POV and OpenVR HMD/controller tracking every `intervalMs`, including exact controller packet/button/touch/axis state, and captures the normalized Skyrim input chain, menu/lifecycle changes, cell transitions, console commands, and a scene manifest on one monotonic clock. `allowNoPlayer=true` permits main-menu/new-game capture before a player exists; optional `correlationId` is retained by start, status, and the recording metadata. Capture stops at the replay contract's 60,000-frame or 30-minute limits and reports `limitReached`/`limitReason`; call `'stop'` to persist the bounded recording. `'stop'` writes compact `devbench-recording-3` JSON. `'replay'` can restore the scene, starts one atomic `vrTrackedSet` sequence, and interleaves keyboard transitions on the recording clock. Legacy recordings are upgraded from wand-indexed controller events; ambiguity and unsupported observational events are reported rather than hidden. Use `replayInputs=false` for pose-only replay. Runtime and scene-coupling gates remain enforced unless explicitly overridden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Other mods add their own tools via the C ABI (see [Use devbench from your mod](#use-devbench-from-your-mod)).

## Record, replay, and autorun

The `record` tool captures a manual play-through as a replayable scenario file:

1. Load a save or `coc` to the scene you want to record. To capture a main-menu → new-game
   flow instead, start there and pass `allowNoPlayer=true`.
2. Call `record` with `action='start'` (or press the `recordHotkey`). devbench samples the
   player pose + point-of-view every `intervalMs` ms (default from `recordIntervalMs`, range 10..1800000),
   including HMD and left/right wand world transforms after the player loads. On VR it also
   samples raw OpenVR HMD/left/right tracking-space poses, velocities, validity, connection state,
   device index/class/role, and both controllers' complete packet/button/touch/five-axis state. The
   raw OpenVR stream is available at the main menu before Skyrim creates the player. A background
   sampling thread captures that stream, a one-time scene manifest, and the entry point (the save
   loaded or cell `coc`'d to — captured even for saves/loads you do through the menu).
3. Play through the scene — movement, point-of-view changes, every normalized keyboard/mouse/
   gamepad/VR-controller event, menu and lifecycle transitions, cell transitions
   (doors/`coc`/`cow`), and console commands are captured on the same clock. Then call `record`
   with `action='stop'` (or press the hotkey again). The trajectory is written to
   `Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench/recordings/recording_<stamp>.json` and the path is returned.
   A fresh install ships a ready-to-replay default recording in that same dir —
   `GuardianStonesToWhiterun.json`, a Guardian Stones → Whiterun run that clears the survival
   menu and enables `tgm` before moving — so you can benchmark without recording one first.

   `meta.activityCapture` publishes the activity contract and replay matrix. The top-level
   `activityEvents` stream is capture-complete for the normalized Skyrim event types exposed by
   CommonLib. Activity contract v1.1 records exact controller state per tracking sample; input
   contract v2 replays keyboard transitions and one atomic OpenVR tracked set containing the HMD
   plus both controllers.
   Legacy captures are upgraded using wand indices and inserted transition frames; reports disclose
   any right-handed role fallback or unsupported event instead of pretending it was reproduced.
   Keyboard holds longer than 58 seconds are rejected before replay because the input contract's
   60-second safety lease must retain a release margin; use `replayInputs=false` for those captures.

4. Replay with `record action='replay' path='<file>'`. The atomic HMD/controller stream and recorded
   keyboard transitions use the recording clock by default; pass `replayInputs=false` for pose-only
   behavior. With `restoreScene=true` (default for
   hotkey replay), devbench first re-establishes the entry point (loads the save / `coc`s the
   cell) and waits for the player before running the trajectory. How tightly it reproduces the
   entry depends on the **coupling tier** (anchored / cell / worldspace), chosen from how long
   before recording the entry was set up — see `couplingAnchorMs`/`couplingCellMs`. Before the
   trajectory runs, devbench **asserts** you're in the recorded worldspace/cell and aborts on a
   mismatch (e.g. `coc` ambiguity landing you in the wrong worldspace), so a replay can't quietly
   benchmark the wrong scene. A `coc`/`cow` restore bounces through a neutral cell first
   (`cleanTransition`) to force a loading-screen teardown that some mods need to avoid a CTD.

5. **Format + runtime.** New recordings are `devbench-recording-3`: v2's compact pose steps plus
   one compact activity event per line. A trajectory sample remains
   `{ "pose": [x, y, z, yawDeg, pitchDeg], "wait": ms }` (it expands to
   the same `player.setpos`/`setangle` commands), so a recording is ~7× smaller than the old
   all-console form and stays hand-editable and git-diffable one sample at a time. Each recording
   carries `meta.runtime.compat` — `["se","ae"]` for a flat teleport path, `["vr"]` for a VR
   recording — and replay **gates** on it: a flat path gives non-comparable frames on VR (the HMD
   drives pitch and culling) and vice-versa, so replay aborts on a runtime the recording wasn't
   made for unless you pass `force`. See `default_recordings/` (with its `index.json` + `README`)
   for the curated, `validated` library and the `<StartZone>To<EndZone>` naming convention.

6. **Faster replays.** Pass `timeScale` (0.1..3.0, up to 10.0 with `allowHigh: true`) to `record`
   `action='replay'` to run the recorded trajectory that many times faster in wall time, which is
   the point of the feature: a long benchmark finishes sooner without changing what it measures.
   The setup/restore phase (the entry-point coc/cow and its settle wait) always runs at normal
   speed — a load screen isn't sped up by this, and its settle physics stay predictable — only the
   trajectory itself is scaled. Playback is paced in **game** time — the engine's effective
   multiplier integrated once per frame — so the trajectory keeps its shape and a scale change
   mid-run is absorbed rather than fought. The previous scale is restored when the run ends,
   throws, or is torn down, and the game's speed is never left altered by a run that was abandoned.
   A frame captured at a scale other than 1 is not comparable to a golden, so a run that did not
   play out entirely at 1× sets `goldensEligible: false` and lists `timeScaleChanges[]`
   (`{ gameMs, effective }` per change) — reported, never aborted. Recording is the other
   direction: `record start` is refused (409) while the game is running at a scale other than 1,
   since the capture would be incomparable. Both `record start` and `replay` take
   `allowTimeScale: true` to override that refusal.

A recipe can pin or tune its own coupling in the recording file's `meta.coupling` block,
overriding the global config thresholds:

```jsonc
"meta": { "coupling": { "tier": "anchored" } }                 // force a tier, or
"meta": { "coupling": { "anchorMs": 5000, "cellMs": 30000 } }  // tune the age thresholds
```

**In-game hotkeys** (configured in `config.json`, opt-in, both default to disabled):

- `recordHotkey` — DXScanCode integer; toggles record start/stop. Ignored while the console is
  open. Optionally require Shift with `recordHotkeyShift: true`.
- `replayHotkey` — replays the recording at `replayPath` (or the most recent recording if
  empty). Optionally require Shift with `replayHotkeyShift: true`. `replayRestoreScene`
  controls whether the scene is re-established first.

**Autorun** (`autoRunPath`) replays a recording once on the first `postLoadGame` of the session
with no client connected and no keypress — a fully unattended benchmark. Set
`autoRunRestoreScene: true` (default) to have devbench load the recorded entry save first.

HUD notifications confirm hotkey actions (record started, record stopped, replay started).

## Scripted tests

On either runtime, use `camera {"action":"freecam","on":true}` before `camera drive`,
then `camera {"action":"freecam","on":false}` to restore the previous camera.
Requests complete on the main thread (`queued:false`); allow a rendered frame
after driving before capturing. This path uses the native camera update pipeline
and does not change freeze time; rendered stereo still needs in-game qualification.
Unpatched engine console `tfc`/`ToggleFlyCam` activation still crashes in VR (the
flat runtime's own toggle works correctly there, and DevBench uses it directly).
Use DevBench for the whole enable/drive/disable sequence; externally activated
free cameras are rejected. See [free-camera behavior and validation](docs/free-camera.md).

The **`scenario`** tool runs a timed step list server-side and returns a per-step transcript —
one call replaces hand-chained requests with frame-accurate timing. Each step is a `tool`
dispatch (any registered tool), a fixed `wait`, an event-driven **`waitFor`**, or a state-poll
`waitUntil`. **Prefer `waitFor`** — it keys off the _actual_ Skyrim event (a load is done when
`lifecycle:postLoadGame` fires) rather than a guessed sleep. This is a validated battery — load,
wait for the load event, settle, rotate in place, then enable and restore the camera:

```jsonc
POST /api/tool/scenario          // MCP: tools/call name=scenario — identical body
{
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "game",    "args": { "action": "load", "name": "Save215" } },
    { "waitFor": "postLoadGame", "timeoutMs": 60000 },   // EVENT, not a guessed sleep
    { "waitUntil": "playerLoaded" },                     // belt-and-suspenders state poll
    { "tool": "console", "args": { "command": "player.setangle z 0" } },
    { "wait": 3000 },                                    // pacing with no event → fixed wait
    { "tool": "console", "args": { "command": "player.setangle z 90" } },
    { "wait": 3000 },
    { "tool": "console", "args": { "command": "player.setangle z 180" } },
    { "wait": 3000 },
    { "tool": "console", "args": { "command": "player.setangle z 270" } },
    { "tool": "camera", "args": { "action": "freecam", "on": true } },
    { "tool": "camera", "args": { "action": "freecam", "on": false } }
  ]
}
// -> { "ok": true, "stepsRun": 12, "elapsedMs": 14213,
//      "results": [ { "index": 0, "kind": "tool", "ok": true, ... },
//                   { "index": 1, "kind": "waitFor", "satisfied": true, "elapsedMs": 4870 }, ... ] }
```

`waitFor` shorthands: lifecycle (`postLoadGame`/`saveGame`/`newGame`/`preLoadGame`/
`dataLoaded`/`deleteGame`), or `menuClosed`/`menuOpened` with a `name` (e.g. wait for
`LoadingMenu` to close, or dismiss a modal then wait for it gone); the general form is
`{ "topic": "...", "match": { ... } }`. Add `repeat` (≤1000) to loop the list and
`continueOnError` to keep going past a failed step.

`waitUntil` conditions: `playerLoaded`, `noModal`, `noMenu`.

**Steps dispatch any registered tool — including tools other mods add over the C ABI.** A
consumer mod such as [Open Shaders](https://github.com/alandtse/open-shaders) (a fork of
[Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/180419)) can register
a `feature` tool so `{ "tool": "feature", "args": { "action": "toggle", "shortName": "..." } }`
becomes a valid scenario step — letting a test flip a feature mid-run.

## Use devbench from your mod

Register your own MCP/REST tools (and emit events) into the running host over a small C ABI.
The integration glue (`include/DevBenchAPI.h` + `DevBenchAPI.cpp`) is **MIT** — pick whichever
fits your project:

- **Copy the overlay port** (recommended) — drop `cmake/ports/devbench-api/` into your repo's
  vcpkg overlay and you're done; the portfile fetches the MIT API source (no source copied into
  your tree). This works out of the box — it's exactly what consumers do today:

  ```cmake
  find_package(devbench-api CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(YourPlugin PRIVATE DevBench::API)
  ```

- **Copy the two API files directly** — `DevBenchAPI.h` + `DevBenchAPI.cpp` into your plugin
  and build them; no vcpkg involved. Simplest bootstrap, fully MIT.

After SKSE sends your plugin `kPostLoad`:

```cpp
#include <DevBenchAPI.h>
if (auto* dvb = DevBenchAPI::GetDevBenchInterface001()) {            // null if devbench absent
    dvb->RegisterTool("yourmod.do", R"({"description":"…","inputSchema":{…}})",
                      &YourHandler, yourCtx);                        // handler: C fn ptr + ctx
    dvb->EmitEvent("yourmod.ready", R"({"ok":true})");
}
```

Your tool then appears on both `/mcp` (`tools/list`/`tools/call`) and `/api/tool/<name>`.
Handlers run on the server thread — marshal to the main game thread (SKSE `TaskInterface`) for
anything touching game state. See `include/DevBenchAPI.h` and `cmake/ports/devbench-api/README.md`.

The same interface can drive the game's speed directly (the `game setTimeScale` control), so a mod
can make its own bench finish sooner without going through a tool call. `SetTimeScale` is
non-blocking and callable from any thread, including the main thread — it never waits on the game:

```cpp
if (dvb->GetBuildNumber() >= 12000) {                                // SetTimeScale: 1.20.0+
    dvb->SetTimeScale(3.0F, 600000, "yourmod.bench");                // 3x for 10 minutes, then restore
    const float running = dvb->GetTimeScale();                       // the multiplier live right now
}
```

It returns `false` for an out-of-range scale (0.1..3.0) or while a recording/capture would be made
incomparable, and the lease always restores the previous scale even if your plugin never calls back.

To add a sub-capability **under an existing base tool** — instead of a whole new tool — register an
extension keyed by a string (keeps the agent-facing surface small). Opted-in base tools: `menu` and
`inspect`. E.g. expose load-timing data as a custom `inspect` kind:

```cpp
if (dvb->GetBuildNumber() >= 10500)                                 // RegisterToolExtension: 1.5.0+
    dvb->RegisterToolExtension("inspect", "yourmod.loadtimes",
                               R"({"description":"per-plugin load timings"})", &YourHandler, ctx);
```

Driven as `inspect kind="yourmod.loadtimes"` (same handler contract — it receives the full base-tool
args). **Discoverable on the first call:** registering a kind rebuilds the `inspect` tool so your key
appears in its `kind` enum + description in `tools/list` (a `notifications/tools/list_changed` is
emitted, so a client that connected before your mod loaded refreshes) — no `kind=extensions` round-trip
needed. Pass a `"description"` in the descriptor; it's shown inline. For menus,
`RegisterToolExtension("menu", name, …)` (or the older `RegisterMenuHandler`, 1.4.0+) registers a
`menu invoke name=<name>` handler — also surfaced in the `menu` tool's description and `menu list`'s
`registered`; `menu open` on a registered name returns a 400 pointing you at `invoke`. Opening/closing/
listing engine menus already works generically — only custom interaction/data needs a handler.

**Only extend a base tool whose name already means what you're adding — or a cold agent won't find it.**
An LLM client triaging a long tool list reads a tool's existing summary as its whole story before
reading the full schema. A/B-tested with two cold subagents (same task, same target mod, no other
context): one build exposed a settings-command/query dispatcher as its own top-level tool
(`yourmod.actions`); the other bolted the identical dispatcher onto `menu` via new `op` values
(`op:"invokeCommand"`, alongside the existing `open`/`close`/`toggle`). The agent given the separate
tool found it immediately and used it correctly. The agent given the merged `menu` tool never tried
it — `menu`'s summary reads "open/close/toggle a window," so the agent judged it irrelevant to a
settings task and moved on, missing the extra `op` values entirely even though they were fully
present in the schema — then fell back to hand-deriving raw state to accomplish the task, the exact
fragile path the dispatcher existed to avoid. `RegisterToolExtension` keeps the top-level list short,
but that's not free if the extension's job doesn't semantically match the base tool it hides under —
register a new top-level tool instead when it doesn't.

### Design your tools the agentic-renderdoc way

devbench follows the **[agentic-renderdoc](https://github.com/EdenLabs/agentic-renderdoc#why-this-design)**
model: a _thin but powerful_ surface an agent can drive, where a call **returns the value**, not
just an ack. Match that when you register, so an agent gets a coherent bench rather than a pile of
one-off verbs:

- **Return data, not "ok."** A read should answer the question (`{ "loaded": true, "fps": 58 }`),
  not `{ "queued": true }`. Run on the main thread via SKSE's `TaskInterface` and return the
  result synchronously (devbench's own `inspect` does this).
- **Few powerful tools over many narrow ones.** Prefer one `shadercache` tool with an `action`
  enum to four verbs. A general primitive (an `eval`-style entry into your subsystem) beats a
  tool per operation.
- **Self-describe.** Put a real `inputSchema` and a clear `description` on every tool — that
  _is_ the MCP schema and the REST docs; it's how an agent discovers what you offer cold.
- **Make failure legible.** Validate inputs and return an actionable error (what was wrong + how
  to list valid values), rather than silently succeeding.

### Events

`EmitEvent(topic, payload)` publishes to the **same bus** every listener already reads (MCP
notifications + REST `/api/events?since=N`) — your events are first-class, delivered exactly like
devbench's built-in `menu`/`lifecycle` events. devbench can't tell which mod emitted an event (the
interface is shared), so **namespace your topics** the way you namespace tool names —
`yourmod.somethingHappened` — to make the origin clear and avoid collisions with other mods.

## Performance data

devbench publishes semantic **`EventBus` events** — `record.started`/`record.stopped`,
`scene.cellLoaded`, `menu`, `lifecycle`, and `health.stalled`/`health.resumed` — so a client can align a capture to those
boundaries (and the `scenario` tool returns per-step timings synchronously) — but devbench does
not collect or serve profiling data itself.
Frametime and GPU metrics are left to dedicated clients: pair devbench with a Tracy-instrumented
mod (using the `tracy` MCP) or any other profiler to annotate captures with what the bench was
doing.
