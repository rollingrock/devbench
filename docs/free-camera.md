# DevBench free camera

DevBench's `camera` tool drives the engine's `FreeCameraState` directly on both runtimes,
via the shared `FreeCamera` module. The two runtimes need different activation paths:

- **Flat (SE/AE)**: the engine's own `PlayerCamera::ToggleFreeCameraMode` works correctly —
  confirmed by decompile, it pushes the prior state before switching and restores it on
  exit — so DevBench calls it directly. No workaround needed.
- **VR**: the same native function is broken (see below); DevBench enters and restores the
  free-camera state by hand instead.

The rest of this document is VR-specific RE evidence for that workaround; it does not apply
to the flat runtime, whose native toggle needs no repair.

## Evidence from running-game memory

These findings come from preserved, decrypted **live mapped-memory images**, captured from running Skyrim VR processes on 2026-08-22 and 2026-08-25. The packed executable on disk was not the analysis input. Addresses below are RVAs relative to `SkyrimVR.exe`; raw images are not included in this repository.

| `0x878F10`            | Native exit pops the engine's temporary return-state stack, falling back to first-person if empty. A replacement using its own retained return state must restore that state directly.                                     |

The native toggle's `0xC3` function bytes are identical across four preserved live images. This is an engine activation defect, not evidence of an NR setting or missing controller causing the crash.

The remaining camera pipeline exists in VR. `PlayerCamera::Update` (`0x875F00`) reaches `TESCamera::Update` (`0x505DD0`) and the active state's VR update slot. Free-camera Update writes the camera node transform. The VR late update also reaches the state's update through `0x505EF0`; the free-camera thunk forwards to its real Update. The stereo camera path (`0xCAC700`/`0xCAC900`) composes the camera world transform with each eye's eye-to-head transform. These observations support the implementation path; they do not replace a rendered stereo test.

## Implementation constraints

Read source rotation and translation through VR virtual slots **5 and 6**, respectively. Their flat-game slots differ. Retain the prior camera state strongly, initialize the actual free-camera state, and use `SetState` for entry and restoration. Do not use the broken native toggle or the VR `PushCameraState` stub.

The `camera` tool leaves `freezeTime` untouched. Its free camera can therefore run while the game continues normally, or while an independently established freeze remains active. Free-camera pitch/yaw are native free-camera angles in radians; arbitrary combined Euler angles reported for a world matrix are not automatically interchangeable with that convention.

This fix is scoped to DevBench's `camera` actions. Native console **`tfc` and `ToggleFlyCam` remain unsafe** unless separately repaired: their command handler at `0x326280` calls the same broken toggle at `0x32630F`.

Use DevBench for the complete enable/drive/disable sequence. `camera get` reports `freeCamOwned` on VR, in addition to `freeCam` and `freeCamBackend`. An externally activated free camera is not owned by DevBench: enable, drive, and disable requests reject it with HTTP 409 rather than promise a round trip they cannot restore. Observing an intervening camera state invalidates the retained ownership. This is not an engine-wide ownership lock: another mod can leave and re-enter the same state between tool calls without being detected. Mixing DevBench with console toggles or another camera controller during one free-camera session is unsupported, even if the console toggle is separately repaired.

Activation clears the free state's latched movement inputs, which the native Begin/End methods leave behind. Save loading blocks new free-camera mutations and invalidates commands queued for the previous scene. Main-thread work that has not started is abandoned after its deadline or caller cancellation. A callback already executing cannot be interrupted safely; a timeout reporting that case requires reading the camera state before deciding what to do next.

If restoration is rejected before a save load, DevBench discards all retained camera pointers and retries using the loaded scene's registered normal VR state. It leaves a camera already changed by loading alone. If that recovery is also rejected or the scene is not ready, it logs the failure; a fresh `camera {"action":"freecam","on":false}` retries using current scene state and reports HTTP 500 until recovery succeeds. Observing any departure from free camera cancels pending recovery, so a later external activation remains protected. This recovery applies only after a failed restoration of a DevBench-owned camera.

## Relationship to an engine repair

A complete native repair must initialize the actual free state, switch into it, and restore the correct prior state on exit. Guarding the invalid pointer alone does not supply the missing activation. If an engine-fix plugin provides that complete repair, this direct-state workaround is no longer required merely to prevent the native activation crash on that installation. DevBench's synchronous commands, ownership checks, lifecycle protection, diagnostics, and regression tests still serve its automation API. This implementation does not detect or depend on an engine-fix plugin and continues using its own backend when one is installed.

The added capability is detached-camera translation and rotation, with restoration of the previous view. Driving the camera deliberately leaves the player in place. It does not add player locomotion, controller support, a native console repair, or a freeze-time command. The remaining DevBench tools retain their existing behavior.

## Focused in-game test

The opt-in HTTP regression module `tests/http/test_camera_freecam.py` checks repeated enable/drive/restore, idempotent requests, separate yaw and pitch changes, persistent camera-node transforms, invalid drive inputs, and the player's unchanged position. Both `DEVBENCH_TEST_FREECAM=1` and an explicit `DEVBENCH_URL` are required; then run `python -m pytest tests/http/test_camera_freecam.py -v`. The module skips before discovery otherwise. It requires an already loaded scene and never bootstraps one. It checks the repaired backend and process identity before camera mutations, including cleanup, and stops issuing commands when that check fails. A visually inspected stereo pair remains necessary to qualify presentation.

Use an already loaded scene with visible nearby geometry. A Valve null HMD is sufficient; controllers are not required. Capture both eyes and the player pose, and retain the initial camera state and freeze status where diagnostics expose them.

1. Read `camera {"action":"get"}`, then enable with `camera {"action":"freecam","on":true}`. Verify `freeCam:true`, continuing game frames, and no unexpected initial view jump.
2. Use `camera {"action":"drive",...}` to establish a nearby position with explicit pitch/yaw. Capture both eyes. Move 100 world units on one axis while keeping those angles fixed. Verify visible parallax in both eyes and an unchanged player position.
3. Keep the position fixed and change yaw by `0.25` radians, then pitch by `0.15` radians. Verify that the rendered view responds in both eyes, with consistent stereo alignment.
4. Disable with `camera {"action":"freecam","on":false}`. Verify `freeCam:false`, restoration of the prior camera mode, and continued normal VR rendering.
5. Repeat the enable/drive/disable sequence three times. Also repeat an already enabled request and an already disabled request; neither should toggle the state unexpectedly or replace the retained return state.
6. Confirm freeze status is unchanged throughout. Run the same round trip once with an independently established freeze if that behavior is being qualified.
7. After leaving free camera, verify normal gameplay camera updates still work. Additionally test loading a save while free camera is active: requests queued before or during loading must not activate or drive the camera in the new scene, and a fresh post-load enable/drive/disable sequence must restore that scene's original camera.

Passing means visible camera movement with the player stationary, coherent stereo, reliable restoration, and no crash. A successful tool receipt or changing state ID alone is insufficient.
