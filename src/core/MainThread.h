	/// calling (listener) thread until it returns, propagating its JSON result — or

	///
	/// This is the value-returning primitive that lets tools read live game/render
	/// state synchronously (the agentic-renderdoc "Eval returns a value" model)
	/// rather than fire-and-forget + poll. Throws TaskTimeout (HTTP 504) if the task
	/// does not finish within `a_timeout` (e.g. the main thread is stalled mid-load).
	/// Tasks still queued at their deadline are abandoned and will not invoke a_fn.
	/// Already-running tasks cannot be interrupted and may finish after a timeout.
	///
	/// MUST be called from a non-main thread (the server listener). Calling it on the
	/// main thread would deadlock — the task can never run while this blocks.
	///
	/// a_keepWaiting: optional liveness flag. If it clears mid-wait, RunAndWait returns
	/// json(nullptr) at once (the caller stopped waiting, e.g. the recorder shutting down)
	/// instead of blocking the full timeout; a task that has not started is abandoned.
	/// An already completed result or exception is still returned; running tasks may finish.

	/// one: PendingTasks() > 0 while this stops advancing = tasks aren't completing.
