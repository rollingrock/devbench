// Pure image-comparison primitives — decode, crop, SSIM, golden scoring. Zero dependency on
// RE/SKSE (only stb_image + std::filesystem + json), so this is unit-testable in the
// host-independent `devbench-tests` target (see tests/Ssim_test.cpp) with no game required.
// `Capture.cpp` is the only real caller — it resolves a relative golden path against GameRoot()
// BEFORE calling in here, so this module never needs to know anything about "the game" at all.
