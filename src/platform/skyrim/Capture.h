// capture: take a screenshot at a replay checkpoint (or ad hoc), and return its path plus
// correlation metadata. Devbench never scores images — that is entirely an external (Python)
// concern; this tool's only job is capture + a reliable "the file is ready" signal.
//
// Capture is deliberately PLUGIN-AGNOSTIC: devbench does not implement its own D3D11/image-codec
// capture pipeline (real graphics-engine code it doesn't own anywhere else). Instead it defines a
// capability CONTRACT any consumer plugin can implement via the existing C-ABI
// `RegisterToolExtension("capture", <key>, …)` mechanism — Open Shaders is the reference
// implementation, not a hardcoded dependency. A small `kind=native` fallback exists for when no
// provider is registered: a main-thread flag flip against vanilla's own `MenuControls::
// QueueScreenshot()` plus a directory poll — no D3D11, no image codec, deliberately lower quality
// than any registered provider (see Handle's kind-resolution rule).
